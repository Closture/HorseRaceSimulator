# HorseRaceSimulator

## Overview

The Horse Racing Simulator is a Java-based program designed to simulate horse races with customisable parameters. It comprises two main parts: Part 1, which focuses on the textual version of the simulation, and Part 2 (not completed), which introduces a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user interaction.

## Features

### Part 1
- **Horse Class**: Represents individual horses participating in the race. Encapsulates horse attributes and provides methods for manipulation.
- **Race Class**: Manages the racing process, including horse movement and race outcome determination.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensures data integrity and confidentiality by encapsulating fields and providing accessor and mutator methods.

### Part 2
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Allows users to interact with the simulation through a  user-friendly graphical interface.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Provides visual feedback on the race progress and outcome through intuitive graphics.

## Usage

### Part 1
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the Part1 folder: `cd HorseRaceSimulator/Part1`
3. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. Run the simulation: `java Main`

### Part 2
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the Part2 folder: `cd HorseRaceSimulator/Part2`
3. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. Run the GUI application: `java MainGUI`

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
